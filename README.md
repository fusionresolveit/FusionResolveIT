## Introduction

This version is at the beginning a fork version of [GLPI](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/).
We have rewritten about all the code with new framework.


## Why this version ?

Many features are not secured for us in GLPI and the code is not enough stable.
So we have forked and in same time rewritten near all the code.
